- interviewer guidelines: in general *and* per exercise
- help text should walk through solution
- REACTO really should be RE(AO)+CT
- time difficulty
- "make problems not impossible"
- follow-up exersises per exercise
- slides from Tessa
- es6?
- lesson per exercise
- incorporate some tool to help with "stepping through" the execution flow
- exercises require different amounts of time

# Todo

- anagram detector: try solution where you XOR codes for each character
- priority queue: actually make a heap
- priority queue: actually describe what's going on, what a heap is
- maybe es6 everything
- consider dropping half of composition and inheritance
- consider moving "dictionary word finder" to optimizations
- consider simpler log n exercise for big-o, that is, instead of "dictionary word finder"
- consider dropping one of the dynamic programming exercises from optimizations
